Back-end Cataloging Requirements
================================

Basic Description
=================

an interface that will allow librarians to take digitized content in different formats (video, PDF, images) and upload it to a server via an upload form. That form will also need to allow the librarian to enter metadata (field definitions will be provided by us) to be stored in a MySQL database. The content itself will be stored on disk with some kind of pointer in the database to indicate where it can be retrieved later.

SQL Schema
==========

NOTE: For datetime_start and datetime_end, material uploaded may span a period of time.  For example, a PDF of scanned newspapers ranging from April 1, 1940 through April 17, 1940.  In that case, datetime_start would be 1940-04-01 00:00:00 and datetime_end would be 1940-04-17 23:59:59.  For a single date, just that day and time would be used (ie, a lecture recording that took place on April 17, 2013 from 5:00PM through 7:00PM).
